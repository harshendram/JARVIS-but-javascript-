JARVIS (A voice controlled AI like assistant inspired by the character of ironman)  is a fully functional voice controlled assistant made only using vanila Javascript(no libraries used).
while making this project I have explored the other part of JS and knowing some of the inbuilt functions,objects and properties of JS.
Although this can be made more functional by connecting chatgpt API and more interactive by fetching the temp of cpu,weather and show them at the intialization of jarvis.
